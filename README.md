If you'd like to join in on this book club session, you can fork this
repository and make a PR with your answers to the questions after you've read the respective chapter.

Let's say you want to answer the questions in Chapter 1. Make a copy of
the questions in the chapter, and rename the file something like
`$YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME-answers.md`. Then, after answering the questions,
edit this README and add a link to your answers, and file a PR to this
repo, where a maintainer will merge it in.

Every week, new questions will be added for the chapter we're reading,
so be on the lookout for that.
